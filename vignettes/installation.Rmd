## Installation

### Installation from Source
__rmsutilityr__ is a local source packages that must be installed prior to 
installing __animalr__.

For example, a very manual approach is to use the following code, which
assumes you have all of the dependencies already installed:
```{r install-rmsutilityr, include = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
install_path <- "c:/R Library"
source_path <- "d:Labkey data"
source <- "rmsutilityr.1.0.56.tar.gz"
install.packages(paste0(source_path, "/", source), type = "source", repos = NULL,
                     lib = install_path)
source <- "animalr.0.1.86.tar.gz"
install.packages(paste0(source_path, "/", source), type = "source", repos = NULL,
                     lib = install_path)

```
One or more of these will fail if you do not have the dependencies already 
installed, but the error message will provide the name(s) of the packages 
needed.
However, as soon as one of the source packages is updated that code no longer 
work because the filename is wrong.

Assuming you have a version of __rmsutilityr__ installed you can simply use 
the following code, which will find all of the dependencies, install them,
locate the most recent source versions of the packages __rmsutilityr__,
__animalr__, and __animalr__, find th.
```{r semi-auto-install, eval = FALSE, include = TRUE}
library(rmsutilityr)
source_names <- c("rmsutilityr", "animalr")
source_path <- "d:Labkey data/"
## dependencies becomes the collection of packages needed to support our
## custom packages
dependencies <- make_package_dependency_list(source_names, source_path)
## We are installing binary packages first and then our local source
dependencies <- remove_these_str(dependencies, expunge = source_names)
install.packages(dependencies, type = "binary",
                 repos = "https://cran.revolutionanalytics.com",
                 lib = lib_path)
update.packages(lib.loc = lib_path,
                repos = "https://cran.revolutionanalytics.com", ask = FALSE)

install_from_source(source_names, source_path, install_path)

```

### Github.com Installation

It is much easier to install directly from
[github.com/rmsharp/animalr](https://github.com/rmsharp/animalr) as all of 
the dependencies are automatically installed as well.

You can install **animalr** from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rmsharp/animalr")

```

All missing dependencies should be automatically installed.
